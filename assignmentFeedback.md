# Feedback from doing the Assignments

## Development essentials

- [x] Discord - I am slightly worried about how organized it will be this semester. Last semester, it felt a little like a mess.
- [x] The Console - I hope the students will take the time to learn how to use terminal (It was very useful for all of my other CS classes.) This will be a repeat for any students coming from CS 224. I don't know if any of my other classes I have taken have explicitly taught me how to use the terminal. **Is there maybe a game we can direct students towards?**
- [x] Github - I'm really excited that students are required to learn github. None of the other classes I've taken have explicitly taught it
- [x] Codepen - Code pen is incredible. [I watched a video about it](https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/ExpmbwR) and the potential codepen is remarkable. Even the little that I've used it, I've found it has helped me learn a lot. I think that for this class, a lot of students are going to learn a lot. I can understand why this website has been so successful. I am interested to see how students interact with it. It would be nice to be able to edit code at the same time as students. They have education features too which I thought was cool. It feels more like a pen and so I can change stuff easier which allows for more creativity too. I feel like I get a better understanding of code too, rather than just looking at someone's, because I can mess it up without actually messing it up! I'm excited to use code pen.
- [x] Start up specification - I liked how the name of this changed from creative project because it more accurately depicts what it is. I think we are going to end up with cooler projects because of it.
  - **Students were confused because they didn't know what some of the technologies were**
  - maybe we could have them brainstorm 15 different ideas and then pick one, maybe we'd get cooler ideas that way.

# Web Servers

- [x] AWS - EC2 I thought this intro was phenomenal. I think we will still get some students that mess up. But, the desciption and how it seemed to work was great. I REALLY like the elastic IP addresses. I had no idea that was a thing, we had so many problems with that last semester. I think students ultimately missed out because they didn't have a final project to keep running at the end of the semester. I REALLY liked the credit specification (AWS) thing, that caused SO many issues last semester. _It didn't work for me_ but I think that is just becaues I might have something weird about my account, I've had it for 6 months and there are a couple of odd things. I REALLY liked the AMI, I didn't know that existed either. Hopefully, that will allow us to focus more on development and less on the server stuff.
- [x] AWS - Route 53 - Great tutorial!
- [x] HTTPS, TLS, and certificates - Great tutorial! Very clear, it wasn't confusing at all. I liked how the CaddyFile already has a lot of stuff in it. I think that will save a lot of headache. It feels less overwhelming when there is already edits made to it. I think the most difficult thing will people using vim / the terminal for the first time. I wonder how many freshmen we have and how it will change in coming semesters. **look up class distribution**

# HTML and CSS

- [x] HTML introduction - I like the assignment
- [x] HTML structure - I like the assignment
- [x] HTML input - I like the assignment.
- [x] HTML media - I like the assignment.
- [x] HTML website - I REALLY like how the deployment process works. It was very easy and clear on how to do it. I think the only issue we might have is people learning how to use the command line. But, it's a really good skill to have.
- [x] Simon HTML - I liked it! I think it is a great example for the students. Should this be before the HTML website?

# I think there should be a break right here in content, split up the CSS and HTML.

- [x] CSS practice - I like the assignment. I think it enables the students to learn if they choose to do so.
- [x] CSS flex - Ha! I did it!
