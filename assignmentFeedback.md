# Feedback from doing the Assignments

## Development essentials

- [x] Discord - I am slightly worried about how organized it will be this semester. Last semester, it felt a little like a mess.
- [x] The Console - I hope the students will take the time to learn how to use terminal (It was very useful for all of my other CS classes.) This will be a repeat for any students coming from CS 224. I don't know if any of my other classes I have taken have explicitly taught me how to use the terminal. **Is there maybe a game we can direct students towards?**
- [x] Github - I'm really excited that students are required to learn github. None of the other classes I've taken have explicitly taught it
- [x] Codepen - Code pen is incredible. [I watched a video about it](https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/ExpmbwR) and the potential codepen is remarkable. Even the little that I've used it, I've found it has helped me learn a lot. I think that for this class, a lot of students are going to learn a lot. I can understand why this website has been so successful. I am interested to see how students interact with it. It would be nice to be able to edit code at the same time as students. They have education features too which I thought was cool. It feels more like a pen and so I can change stuff easier which allows for more creativity too. I feel like I get a better understanding of code too, rather than just looking at someone's, because I can mess it up without actually messing it up! I'm excited to use code pen.
- [x] Start up specification - I liked how the name of this changed from creative project because it more accurately depicts what it is. I think we are going to end up with cooler projects because of it.
  - **Students were confused because they didn't know what some of the technologies were**
  - maybe we could have them brainstorm 15 different ideas and then pick one, maybe we'd get cooler ideas that way.

# Web Servers

- [x] AWS - EC2 I thought this intro was phenomenal. I think we will still get some students that mess up. But, the desciption and how it seemed to work was great. I REALLY like the elastic IP addresses. I had no idea that was a thing, we had so many problems with that last semester. I think students ultimately missed out because they didn't have a final project to keep running at the end of the semester. I REALLY liked the credit specification (AWS) thing, that caused SO many issues last semester. _It didn't work for me_ but I think that is just becaues I might have something weird about my account, I've had it for 6 months and there are a couple of odd things. I REALLY liked the AMI, I didn't know that existed either. Hopefully, that will allow us to focus more on development and less on the server stuff.
- [x] AWS - Route 53 - Great tutorial!
- [x] HTTPS, TLS, and certificates - Great tutorial! Very clear, it wasn't confusing at all. I liked how the CaddyFile already has a lot of stuff in it. I think that will save a lot of headache. It feels less overwhelming when there is already edits made to it. I think the most difficult thing will people using vim / the terminal for the first time. I wonder how many freshmen we have and how it will change in coming semesters. **look up class distribution**

# HTML and CSS

- [x] HTML introduction - I like the assignment
- [x] HTML structure - I like the assignment
- [x] HTML input - I like the assignment.
- [x] HTML media - I like the assignment.
- [x] HTML website - I REALLY like how the deployment process works. It was very easy and clear on how to do it. I think the only issue we might have is people learning how to use the command line. But, it's a really good skill to have.
- [x] Simon HTML - I liked it! I think it is a great example for the students. Should this be before the HTML website?

# I think there should be a break right here in content, split up the CSS and HTML.

- [x] CSS practice - I like the assignment. I think it enables the students to learn if they choose to do so.
- [x] CSS flex - Ha! I did it!
- [x] CSS frameworks - I like this assignment. I learned stuff about bootstrap I hadn't realized before
- [x] Simon CSS - I like it! I did it and didn't have too many issues.
- [ ] UX design - There is some amazing content here. Very informative.

# Web services

- [x] Fetch - I think it's a great introduction to APIs/fetch. I am concerned about students understanding JSON objects. For example, doing ``response.value`` to get the joke was something that was difficult last semester. I don't know how extensively we will be using APIs this semester, but that might be something good to teach more in depth. Another thing that might be helpful with this assignment is shown it being done with async / await / axios as well as fetch because I think those are important to understand as well. I give an example of this on a [code pen](https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/bGjLQQM?editors=1111)
- [x] Node.js - I struggled to install this on windows. I ended up going to the [node website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and a [nvm website](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/) to be able to install this. I don't know if this is something that others will run into as well, or if it something odd with my computer. 
- [x] Express - I am concerned with how much information we are giving at once. I did not understand everything when I read through it. I need to go back and spent some time trying to understand. I am familiar with express from TAing and taking the class. The other thing is **curl commands**. These I think should be explained in more detail. Last semester, some students really struggled with those. I didn't quite understand the purpose of cookie-parser with this assignment. If it can be simplified, I think it should be. 
- [ ] Debugging Node - I learned A TON! THIS IS GOOD STUFF! I have avoided using commands when debugging, but they are super helpful. Nodemon is also super super neat and I wish that I had had that previously. I am a little confused about whether you can use it in the debugger in VSC, or just doing nodemon file.js. I think a simple video would be extremely helpful as well. 
- [ ] UI testing and Endpoint testing were EXTREMELY interesting and useful. 
- [ ] Simon service
- [ ] Data services
- [ ] Simon DB
- [ ] Account creation and login
- [ ] Simon Login - I copied parts of code, but for the most part typed it out and tried to understand and come up with stuff on my own. The modal for bootstrap for the error message was giving me trouble, I might have messed something up while copying code. The login button didn't seem to work unless you cleared the storage when you logged out. I also don't know if that is me copying code incorrectly. 
- [ ] Debugging Websocket chat - seemingly simple! The video/gif was super helpful! I wonder if there is a way to implement more videos. 
- [ ] Websocket Chat - I did it!

# Web frameworks, mobile, and security

- [ ] React components
- [ ] React tic-tac-toe tutorial - I think this is great that they have to do this.
- [ ] React reactivity - **used a hook before introducing them in the next reading** 
- [ ] React hooks - I am still confused on the use effect hook 
- [ ] React CLI - This is incredible content. Very clear. I learned a lot reading through it. I've been doing a lot of stuff wrong with react cli based on what I read. I'm not sure if the students will understand the components across the different files. **I think a simple video explaination with someone explaining what they are doing while creating a component (file creation / import / export / including it else where) would be extremely helpful.**  **Is there a debug react tutorial?**
- [ ] React router - **this might be difficult to move to CLI** this was a huge sticking point last semester. It might be a good idea to require a screenshot showing they were able to get it working locally as well as on code pen. (at least to the basic routing) I started working on simon react and then got stuck on react browser and needed to come back even though I thought I understood at least the basics.
- [ ] Simon react - Overall, it was an adventure to implement this. The assignment readme repository has more information about how long it took me to do things and what I struggled with. This may be a good indication for what students might struggle with as well. 
  It took a lot longer than I thought it would. I learned a lot. I think students will struggle or maybe not do it at all because it is towards the end of the semester and students know what grade they can get without doing it. I think it is an incredibly valuable exercise, but most students probably won't take the time to do it.
  I think ports will difficult for a lot of students because they haven't seen them before.
