# My Would Be Assignment Submssions

## Development essentials

- [x] Discord - I am on discord. I've found it interesting how versitile and interesting discord has ended up being. From getting laughs from memes to being able to communicate.
- [x] The Console - I am proficient with the console. I was suprised that I learned something when I did this assignment (at least part of the assignment). I learned that "less" is another text editor on the terminal. I thought that was cool. I hadn't run into that or "more" previously either. I also liked the command `ls ../`. I think that will be very useful in the future.
  - There are other commands listed that I haven't used before that I should come back and learn.
- [x] Github - [repo](https://github.com/math919191/CS260W23) I think I got it. I learned the VSC with git with this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_23KUAEtUM). Learning more about md was helpful too.
  - I need to come back and make sure I really understand merge conflicts and branches. That seemed to be a problem last semester that I need to learn how to teach and do better.
- [x] Codepen - submission - [my forked code pen](https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/ExpmbwR) - I changed the lightening board to be bright pink.
- [x] Start up specification - [Here is my specification](StartUp/specification.md)

# Web Servers

- [x] AWS - EC2 - Submission 3.144.127.129 - somehow it is now http://3.136.196.246/- created a nano server, I'm really curious if it will actually hold up. I don't know if it will. I think those will nano will eventually end up micros, but I'm not sure.
- [x] AWS - Route 53 - rebekahdaniels.net - I am so much more comfortable with A records than I used to be! I was suprised at how easy it was to switch what IP my dns is pointing to.
- [x] HTTPS, TLS, and certificates - it was suprisingly easy. I thought it would be much more difficult, but I've got a working secure website! Caddy is really cool. I want to learn more about all the parts of the caddy file. https://rebekahdaniels.net/ - Why does does http://pickles.rebekahdaniels.net/ work and https://pickles.rebekahdaniels.net/ doesn't?

# HTML and CSS

- [x] HTML introduction - [code pen html intro](https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/yLqbPxP) - I like this assignment. I learned that there is a main HTML tag. I keep forgetting the <a> tag for links -- hopefully I can remember that one this time (:
- [x] HTML structure - [code pen html structure](https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/JjBNOmx) - I like this assignment. I hadn't thought about just how logical and simple html structure is and how well it has held up over the last several decades.
- [x] HTML input - [code pen html input](https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/bGjYVqQ) I was unaware of some of these inputs. I didn't know that you could use regular expressions either.
- [x] HTML media - [code pen HTML media](https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/NWBwGwJ?editors=1010) I thought the SVG graphics were cool, I hadn't really seen those before.
- [x] HTML website - [website url](https://rebekahdaniels.net/) - really neat! I think it's a really good way to deploy the website. I wasn't famililar with the shell script, but it makes sense. I think I will definitely use that in the future. I like the deployment process. It's not complicated, and it's not cloud9!
- [x] Simon HTML - [simon html](https://simon.rebekahdaniels.net/) - I coded it all up! I think that is what I'm gonna do for the rest of the simon assignments and not focus on my start up. If I can understand what is going on with simon then hopefully I can effectively help students with it.

# I think there should be a break right here in content, split up the CSS and HTML.

- [x] CSS practice - [animated CSS](https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/dyjZGZw) - I didn't know just how much you can do with just plain CSS! I created a slide box.
- [x] CSS flex - I did it! [responsive CSS](https://rebekahdaniels.net/responsiveCSS/). I hated trying to make responsive websites, but it's easier! I finally created a website about me. It took forever to finally create a site about me. I've wanted to do it for a really long time and make it look good. Couple of neat things I learned -- viewheight and view width are extremely helpful, there are variables for CSS colors, according to a website, you only need to use 3 colors and that's all, I was reminded how to do fonts, I was reminded how cool coolors.co is,
- [x] CSS frameworks - I didn't change anything. [code pen](https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/vYaWKgW). In generally, bootstrap is great. I failed to realize that bootstrap's downfall is its popularity. It looks very similar throughout. Very interesting.
- [x] Simon CSS - I did it! [my simon website](simon.rebekahdaniels.net) and [my simon css files](simon/simon-css/styles.css) . I am getting better at doing CSS. I know how to do all this CSS stuff on my own. I only referenced his code a few times. 
- [x] UX design - I found the information about websites helpful, even though I've seen it a few times. Here is an [interesting website](https://github.com/) that I liked. It is github's homepage. It is very useable and I can get to what I want to from it. It would be nice, however, if they had a feature to list the most recent repos, not the most used. (CS235 repo keeps coming up, even though I probably won't ever use that repo again.)
