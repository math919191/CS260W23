# My Would Be Assignment Submssions

## Development essentials

- [x] Discord - I am on discord. I've found it interesting how versitile and interesting discord has ended up being. From getting laughs from memes to being able to communicate.
- [x] The Console - I am proficient with the console. I was suprised that I learned something when I did this assignment (at least part of the assignment). I learned that "less" is another text editor on the terminal. I thought that was cool. I hadn't run into that or "more" previously either. I also liked the command `ls ../`. I think that will be very useful in the future.
  - There are other commands listed that I haven't used before that I should come back and learn.
- [x] Github - [repo](https://github.com/math919191/CS260W23) I think I got it. I learned the VSC with git with this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_23KUAEtUM). Learning more about md was helpful too.
  - I need to come back and make sure I really understand merge conflicts and branches. That seemed to be a problem last semester that I need to learn how to teach and do better.
- [x] Codepen - submission - [my forked code pen](https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/ExpmbwR) - I changed the lightening board to be bright pink.
- [x] Start up specification - [Here is my specification](StartUp/specification.md)

# Web Servers

- [x] AWS - EC2 - Submission 3.144.127.129 - somehow it is now http://3.136.196.246/- created a nano server, I'm really curious if it will actually hold up. I don't know if it will. I think those will nano will eventually end up micros, but I'm not sure.
- [x] AWS - Route 53 - rebekahdaniels.net - I am so much more comfortable with A records than I used to be! I was suprised at how easy it was to switch what IP my dns is pointing to.
- [x] HTTPS, TLS, and certificates - it was suprisingly easy. I thought it would be much more difficult, but I've got a working secure website! Caddy is really cool. I want to learn more about all the parts of the caddy file. https://rebekahdaniels.net/ - Why does does http://pickles.rebekahdaniels.net/ work and https://pickles.rebekahdaniels.net/ doesn't?

# HTML and CSS

- [x] HTML introduction - [code pen html intro](https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/yLqbPxP) - I like this assignment. I learned that there is a main HTML tag. I keep forgetting the <a> tag for links -- hopefully I can remember that one this time (:
- [x] HTML structure - [code pen html structure](https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/JjBNOmx) - I like this assignment. I hadn't thought about just how logical and simple html structure is and how well it has held up over the last several decades.
- [x] HTML input - [code pen html input](https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/bGjYVqQ) I was unaware of some of these inputs. I didn't know that you could use regular expressions either.
- [x] HTML media - [code pen HTML media](https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/NWBwGwJ?editors=1010) I thought the SVG graphics were cool, I hadn't really seen those before.
- [x] HTML website - [website url](https://rebekahdaniels.net/) - really neat! I think it's a really good way to deploy the website. I wasn't famililar with the shell script, but it makes sense. I think I will definitely use that in the future. I like the deployment process. It's not complicated, and it's not cloud9!
- [x] Simon HTML - [simon html](https://simon.rebekahdaniels.net/) - I coded it all up! I think that is what I'm gonna do for the rest of the simon assignments and not focus on my start up. If I can understand what is going on with simon then hopefully I can effectively help students with it.

# I think there should be a break right here in content, split up the CSS and HTML.

- [x] CSS practice - [animated CSS](https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/dyjZGZw) - I didn't know just how much you can do with just plain CSS! I created a slide box.
- [x] CSS flex - I did it! [responsive CSS](https://rebekahdaniels.net/responsiveCSS/). I hated trying to make responsive websites, but it's easier! I finally created a website about me. It took forever to finally create a site about me. I've wanted to do it for a really long time and make it look good. Couple of neat things I learned -- viewheight and view width are extremely helpful, there are variables for CSS colors, according to a website, you only need to use 3 colors and that's all, I was reminded how to do fonts, I was reminded how cool coolors.co is,
- [x] CSS frameworks - I didn't change anything. [code pen](https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/vYaWKgW). In generally, bootstrap is great. I failed to realize that bootstrap's downfall is its popularity. It looks very similar throughout. Very interesting.
- [x] Simon CSS - I did it! [my simon website](simon.rebekahdaniels.net) and [my simon css files](simon/simon-css/styles.css) . I am getting better at doing CSS. I know how to do all this CSS stuff on my own. I only referenced his code a few times. 
- [x] UX design - I found the information about websites helpful, even though I've seen it a few times. Here is an [interesting website](https://github.com/) that I liked. It is github's homepage. It is very useable and I can get to what I want to from it. It would be nice, however, if they had a feature to list the most recent repos, not the most used. (CS235 repo keeps coming up, even though I probably won't ever use that repo again.) 
- [ ] Start up HTML and CSS - I'll come back if I have time.

# JavaScript
### I am familiar with all of the following things in Javascript. I will come back if I have time. 
- [ ] JavaScript types, operators, conditionals, and loops
- [ ] JavaScript functions
- [ ] JavaScript arrow functions
- [ ] JavaScript arrays
- [ ] JavaScript objects and classes
- [ ] JavaScript regular expressions
- [ ] Javascript rest and spread
- [ ] Javascript destructuring
- [ ] Javascript exceptions
- [ ] Javascript document object model
- [ ] Javascript promises
- [ ] Javascript async/await

- [x] Simon Javascript part 1 - simon.rebekahdaniels.net/play.html - I got the basic js working! I haven't gotten the login or the scores to populate on the other pages. Overall, I'm really pleased that I was able to do that. It took roughly 2 hours to complete some of the basic logic for the simon itself. I didn't understand all of what the code did in the professors' example.
- [x] simon js part 2 - I need to populate the score and the names 
- [ ] Start up Javascript - I'll come back if I have time.

# Midterm

- [ ] Take it

# Web services

- [x] Fetch - [my code pen](https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/bGjLQQM) - chuck norris jokes - I found the use of the query selector and stringify interesting, I hadn't seen those before. 
- [x] Node.js - Node is freaking amazing. I'm realizing that the more I use it. There are lots of uses for it. I also talked to some family members who work in CS, and it was interesting to hear them talk about Node.js and how they also are familiar with it. I struggled to install it on windows.
- [x] Express - It's neat that we can set up our own endpoints. I got it working. **come back when I have time**
- [x] Simon service - I learned more about how seperate the back end should be from the front. It helped to solidify some of my understanding about how node works. I am still confused on how to debug locally. It doesn't quit make sense how to run the back end on the same port as the website locally.  
- [x] Data services - I liked this assignment. I was able to add local variables which was cool to learn how to do on windows. I didn't like the GUI though for doing this. 
- [x] Simon DB - I did it! I was able to do this without too much of a problem. The endpoints made it really easy to do this. I didn't restart my pm2 and actually pulled Professor Jensen's data from his database. It really confused me for a minute.  
- [x] Account creation and login - I did it! Most of the backend stuff made sense. I need to look into it a little more though. The Node packages are extremely useful. 
- [x] Simon Login - I did it! It took longer than I thought it would but it was extremely informative in trying to do it on my own. I ran into a few issues while working on it, but I was able to work through all of them! I figured out how to debug with them on the same port, I don't know why that was causing me so much trouble earlier. I learned about text decoration none to be able to choose which login screen people see. I learned more about databases and inserting into them. I learned more about the debuggers and how powerful those tools are. It was interesting following things through 4 different files to be able to do something to be able to keep the different functionalities partitioned (eg `button in html -> login.js -> index.js -> database.js`). 
- [x] Websocket chat - There was quite of bit of stuff but it made sense!
- [ ] Simon websocket - It looks doable! It isn't as complicated as I though it was. Super neat!
- [ ] Start up service - Will come back if there is time.
