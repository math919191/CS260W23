# Development essentials

- [x] Discord - I am on discord. I've found it interesting how versitile and interesting discord has ended up being. From getting laughs from memes to being able to communicate. I am slightly worried about how organized it will be this semester. Last semester, it felt more like a mess.
- [x] The Console - I am proficient with the console. I was suprised that I learned something when I did this assignment (at least part of the assignment). I learned that "less" is another text editor on the terminal. I thought that was cool. I hadn't run into that or "more" previously either. I also liked the command `ls ../`. I think that will be very useful in the future. I hope the students will take the time to learn how to use terminal (It was very useful for all of my other CS classes.) This will be a repeat for any students coming from CS 224. I don't know if any of my other classes I have taken have explicitly taught me how to use the terminal.
- There are other commands listed that I haven't used before that I should come back and learn.
- [x] Github - repo - https://github.com/math919191/CS260W23 I think I got it. I learned the VSC with git with this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_23KUAEtUM). Learning more about md was helpful too.
- I need to come back and make sure I really understand merge conflicts and branches. That seemed to be a problem last semester that I need to learn how to teach and do better.
- [x] Codepen - submission - my forked code pen - https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/ExpmbwR - I changed the lightening board to be bright pink. Code pen is incredible. I watched a video about it (https://codepen.io/math919191/pen/ExpmbwR) and the potential codepen is remarkable. Even the little that I've used it, I've found it has helped me learn a lot. I think that for this class, a lot of students are going to learn a lot. I can understand why this website has been so successful. I am interested to see how students interact with it. It would be nice to be able to edit code at the same time as students. They have education features too which I thought was cool. It feels more like a pen and so I can change stuff easier which allows for more creativity too. I feel like I get a better understanding of code too, rather than just looking at someone's, because I can mess it up without actually messing it up! I'm excited to use code pen.
- [ ] Start up specification - I liked how the name of this changed from creative project because it more accurately depicts what it is. I think we are going to end up with cooler projects because of it.
- I need to go in and actually do this. Writing words is harder than writing code, but just as important, if not more so.
- **Students were confused because they didn't know what some of the technologies were**
- maybe we could have them brainstorm 15 different ideas and then pick one, maybe we'd get cooler ideas that way.

# Web Servers

- [x] AWS - EC2 - Submission 3.144.127.129 - I thought this intro was phenomenal. I think we will still get some students that mess up. But, the desciption and how it seemed to work was great. I REALLY like the elastic IP addresses. I had no idea that was a thing, we had so many problems with that last semester. I think students ultimately missed out because they didn't have a final project to keep running at the end of the semester. I REALLY liked the credit specification (AWS) thing, that caused SO many issues last semester. ==It didn't work for me== but I think that is just becaues I might have something weird about my account, I've had it for 6 months and there are a couple of odd things. I REALLY liked the AMI, I didn't know that existed either. Hopefully, that will allow us to focus more on development and less on the server stuff.
- I created a nano server, I'm really curious if it will actually hold up. I don't know if it will. I think those will nano will eventually end up micros, but I'm not sure.
- [ ] AWS - Route 53
- I bought my domain name, but it is currently serving content from a different server.
- I need to go through this tutorial so I can see where the students are coming from.
- [ ] HTTPS, TLS, and certificates
- I need to secure my website from the new ip address. That will be a learning experience. I liked how the CaddyFile already has a lot of stuff in it. I think that will save a lot of headache. It feels less overwhelming when there is already edits made to it. I think the most difficult thing will people using vim / the terminal for the first time.
- I wonder how many freshmen we have. **look up class distribution**
