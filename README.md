# CS260W23
 - This is my repo where everything CS260 will live for the Winter 2023 semester.
 - I am a TA for CS 260 (Web Programming) at BYU. 

#### This repository has the following:
- [Assignments I've completed](assignments.md) - This consists of what my submissions would have looked like had I taken the class.
- [Feedback for assignments](assignmentFeedback.md) - This consists of some of my initial reactions of assignments as a TA, feedback, and ideas about assignments.
- [My Start Up - Connect4](./StartUp/specification/specification.md) - Part of the class is to create your own website "start up" assignment. Mine is a Connect 4 website. This is not finished, and will probably be finished last when I have a good grasp on everything else in the class. This is what it [looks like now](https://startup.rebekahdaniels.net) 
- [Simon](./simon) - This is the folder with all the simon projects. Each sub folder represents the implementation of that technology. I want to be able to refer back to each assignment to be able to better help students. The actual website looks like [this](https://simon.rebekahdaniels.net). It is still a work in progress.

#### Some of my work is hosted [here](https://rebekahdaniels.net).
- [Connect 4](https://startup.rebekahdaniels.net) - still a work in progress
- [Simon](https://simon.rebekahdaniels.net) - still a work in progress
- [My portfolio](https://rebekahdaniels.net) - still a work in progress
